# SystemAnalysisandDesign
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass and they wanted a system that allowed their students to book driving lessons, take practice tests, be able to track their progress, and access materials both on and offline. The system also was to manage students, instructors, packages, and payments while being integrated with DMV updates.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well on defining functional and nonfunctional requirements. I also emphasized accessibility, security, and the ability for admin to manage activities across all platforms.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably add more technical detail to the UML diagrams. Adding more attributes and relationships would make the design easier to implement further down the line.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on key activities like booking, tracking progress, and making data management secure. It's important to consider user needs because when a system doesnt match user expectations it will fail to solve actual problems that will then hurt the businesses success.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I gather detailed requirements first and then translate them into system specifications using UML diagrams. In the future I would frequent user feedback to be able to refine the system through development to make sure it meets real user expectations.
